# FashionMNIST-BinarySearch-LR
üê•As an MCA (AI-ML) student, it‚Äôs fascinating to explore how traditional concepts like data structures and algorithms (DSA) meet the cutting-edge world of machine learning and deep learning. Combining these two worlds always makes me wonder‚Äîwhat if we applied algorithmic efficiency to optimize ML models? Or how could ML improve classic search or sort operations? The possibilities feel endless! üß†üí°

In machine learning, hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, regularization parameters, number of layers in neural networks) significantly impact model performance. The process of hyperparameter tuning involves finding the optimal values for these hyperparameters. A form of binary search can be applied here when the relationship between hyperparameters and performance is monotonic or convex (i.e., the performance improves or degrades consistently as the hyperparameter changes).

Recently, I applied this thinking to a project on learning rate optimization using binary search for the Fashion MNIST dataset. üìä The process involved systematically narrowing down the learning rate to find the optimal one, balancing speed and accuracy in the deep learning model.
How It Works:
‚úÖ Data Preprocessing: The Fashion MNIST dataset is loaded and normalized for better model performance.
‚úÖ Model Creation: A convolutional neural network (CNN) is built with multiple layers to classify images.
‚úÖ Binary Search for Optimization: By training the model with different learning rates, the binary search algorithm identifies the best learning rate to maximize accuracy.
‚úÖ Result: The optimal learning rate is chosen based on validation accuracy after several iterations.

This project deepened my understanding of how DSA concepts like binary search can be applied to machine learning for performance improvements.
