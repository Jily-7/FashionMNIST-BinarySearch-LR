In machine learning, hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, regularization parameters, number of layers in neural networks) significantly impact model performance. The process of hyperparameter tuning involves finding the optimal values for these hyperparameters. A form of binary search can be applied here when the relationship between hyperparameters and performance is monotonic or convex (i.e., the performance improves or degrades consistently as the hyperparameter changes).

Recently, I applied this thinking to a project on learning rate optimization using binary search for the Fashion MNIST dataset. ðŸ“Š The process involved systematically narrowing down the learning rate to find the optimal one, balancing speed and accuracy in the deep learning model.
